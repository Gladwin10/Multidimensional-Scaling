# Multidimensional Scaling

*Dataset contains distance between cities in India (in KM) and the dissimilarity index between different cities are calculated and plotted.*

*This analysis provides a quick visual representation of which group of objects are similar or closer to each other in terms of their attributes.*

*This analysis is much suitable to find the dissimilarities between different objects when there are large number of dimensions. In such a case, it will be difficult to manually find out which group of objects are close in terms of attributes and which are not. More or less we are finding out Cluster of objects based on similarity.*
